## Overview

Skii is a global ski resort forum applications that allows members to be part of an interactive, online community where information on the major ski resorts across the world is shared. This week long project expanded on the frontend React skills used for my [Crypto-Index](https://github.com/DanielTockan/Crypto-Index) project, but with an integrated backend using MongoDB and mongoose.
